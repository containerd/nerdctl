          arguments: [25]
        - name: confusing-results

          disabled: true
        - name: comment-spacings
          # 50 occurrences. Makes code look less wonky / ease readability.
          disabled: true
        - name: use-any
          # 30 occurrences. `any` instead of `interface{}`. Cosmetic.
          disabled: true
        - name: empty-lines
          # 85 occurrences. Makes code look less wonky / ease readability.
          disabled: true
        - name: package-comments

          disabled: true
