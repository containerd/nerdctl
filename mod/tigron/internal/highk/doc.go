// Package highk (for "high-Îº dielectric") is a highly experimental leak detection library (for file descriptors and go
// routines).
// It is purely internal for now and used only as part of the tests for tigron.
// TODO:
// - get rid of lsof and implement in go
// - investigate feasibility of adding automatic leak detection for any test using tigron
// - investigate feasibility of adding leak detection for tested binaries
// - review usefulness of uber goroutines leak library
package highk
